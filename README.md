# FeedForwardNetUnity
FeedForwardNet modified to run on the Unity Game Engine

## Instructions for Running
There isn't really a good way to run it. If a person wants the SimpleAI, enable the SimpleAIManager and disable the PlatformerGUI/PlatformerAIManager. If you want the PlatformerAI, disable the SimpleAIManager and enable the PlatformerAIManager and PlatformerGUI.
Note that the platformerAI is enabled by default.

### Prerequisites
A copy of Unity, preferably 2019.4.12f1 or later.
